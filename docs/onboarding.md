# Metropolis (Backend)
Make sure you have python 3.10â€“3.12 installed;
Ideally, you use python 3.12 

## Running Locally

### Nix 
Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download) and [direnv](https://direnv.net) and run:
###### if using direnv
```sh
make
direnv allow
./manage.py migrate
nix run
```
###### If not using direnv:
```sh
nix develop # and run `./manage.py migrate` inside
nix run
```


### Anything besides Nix
If you do not want to use Nix:
```
python -m pip install poetry
poetry install
make # can remove for windows 
poetry run python ./manage.py migrate
poetry run python ./manage.py runserver
```

### Errors
##### Any issue with psycopg2
- `pip install psycopg2-binary` and try again (pip or pip3 not poetry add)
#### Windows
###### poetry ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'charset_normalizer'
reinstall poetry and run poetry install in an elevated (admin) terminal 
#### OpenSSL isn't found
Git installs it, so you can add git's programs to your path
- add git's path (defualt: C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\) to your user path
Since OpenSSL isn't installed, make probably isn't so below are the steps to bypass make
- `cd ./metropolis`
- `openssl genrsa -out local_rsa_privkey.pem 4096`
- `cp .\local_settings_sample.py .\local_settings.py`
## Additional setup/config

copy `./metropolis/local_settings_sample.py` to `./metropolis/local_settings.py` and read the file to change some of the values.


##### Creating your account
1. run `poetry run python ./manage.py createsuperuser` and enter the values
2. run the server and go to the link provided in the terminal
3. click the login button and sign in using the credentials you provided in step 1
4. Look in your console to see the email that was printed out and find the email confirmation url
5. paste that url into your browser
6. sign in using the values you provided in step 1
